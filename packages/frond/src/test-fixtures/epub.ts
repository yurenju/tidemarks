/**
 * Assembles EPUB bytes from a declarative specification.
 *
 * This layer only knows how to assemble a conforming book; it knows nothing about
 * ailments — ailments are expressed in `ailments.ts` as single-point differences against
 * one shared healthy skeleton. This cut is how the requirement "one fixture carries one
 * ailment" is implemented: were ailments scattered through the assembly logic, sooner or
 * later two of them would share an `if`, and the fixtures would start contaminating each
 * other.
 *
 * ## EPUB versions
 *
 * This layer recognises two **versions** (`EpubVersion`): EPUB 3 and EPUB 2. At the
 * packaging layer they are two different shapes, not one skeleton plus an NCX — the latter
 * is the shape inferred from the spec, a model book rather than the shape books actually
 * have (ADR-0010). Every difference is contained in this file, and `ailments.ts` only
 * names which one it wants.
 *
 * **It is not called a "vehicle"**: CONTEXT.md reserves that word for the **navigation
 * document** (`nav.xhtml` and `toc.ncx`), and the version and the navigation vehicle are
 * two different things — ADR-0010's rule 3 is precisely about the "declares 3.x but has
 * only an NCX" case, which cannot be stated at all if the two words are conflated. Issue
 * #22 says vehicle, and that was written before CONTEXT.md narrowed the term.
 *
 * A version governs only the **packaging layer**: the package document, the navigation
 * document, and how the cover is declared. Content documents (XHTML) share one template
 * across both versions. That boundary is deliberate — content documents are what
 * `Renderer` sees, and letting them fork by version would double every content-layer
 * ailment.
