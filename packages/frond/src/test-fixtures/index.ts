/**
 * The synthetic fixture generator — **one ailment per file, and the filename is the
 * ailment's name** (ADR-0007).
 *
 * This is the first layer of test books, and the main one. The value of synthetic
 * fixtures is that they are controllable and nameable: each file reproduces one known
 * ailment exactly, and when a test fails the filename says which ailment has come back.
 *
 * This generator is **published for consumers to use** (the distribution section of #1),
 * so the exports below are part of the product rather than internal details: the ailment
 * list itself is one of this project's most valuable pieces of knowledge, and should not
 * be locked inside a test directory.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * The same input produces a **byte-for-byte identical** file. This is not reproducibility
 * hygiene, it is a hard requirement: regenerate the fixtures and every geometric number
 * drifts, for reasons that have nothing to do with frond's code. All four leaks are
 * explicitly suppressed — ZIP mtimes and external attributes, deflate implementation
 * differences (always stored), `dcterms:modified`, and the identifier (a fixed string
 * rather than a UUID). `tests/node/test-fixtures/determinism.test.ts` proves it by
 * generating twice and comparing hashes.
