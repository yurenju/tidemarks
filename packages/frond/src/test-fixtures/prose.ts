 * There are two reasons for Japanese: vertical is its native form (and the hardest case),
 * and the punctuation marks (`、` `。`) have to resolve to rotated glyphs when vertical,
 * which is the only discriminator in the test environment with any teeth (see
 * docs/test-environment.md). Every paragraph deliberately contains punctuation.

/**

 * `anchorIds` maps a paragraph number (counting from 1) to the `id` to attach. **Only
 * the paragraphs named grow an id**, and the rest are character-for-character unchanged.
 * It serves the nested TOC: the second level points at a position **inside** a Section,
 * and pointing at a non-existent id would give that fixture a second ailment beyond "the
 * TOC has two levels".
 *
 * Attaching ids throughout would achieve the same effect, but it would make the fixture
 * differ from the healthy skeleton by more than a single-point difference requires, and
 * the surplus ids would have nothing pointing at them — real books (Sigil) likewise only
 * put an id at the position the table of contents points to.
 *
 * When omitted the output is character-for-character identical to what it was before this
 * parameter was added — existing fixtures' bytes do not drift because of it.
