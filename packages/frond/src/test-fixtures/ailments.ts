/**
 * The ailment list. **One ailment per file, and the filename is the ailment's name**
 * (ADR-0007).
 *
 * Each ailment is expressed as a **single-point difference** against one shared healthy
 * skeleton — everything else stays healthy. That discipline is the entire value of this
 * set of fixtures: when a test goes red, the filename says which ailment has come back.
 * Once two ailments are crammed into one file, a red light costs time again to work out
 * which of them caused it — which is exactly the drawback of using real books as
 * fixtures.
 *
 * ## The EPUB version is a second axis
 *
 * Beyond the ailment there is the **EPUB version**: EPUB 3 (the default) and EPUB 2
 * (ADR-0010). The version is written as a **filename suffix** — no suffix means EPUB 3,
 * `-epub2` means EPUB 2. This keeps committed fixtures one-to-one with filenames (the
 * source of red-light readability), and makes the two files for one ailment across both
 * versions visibly a pair when placed side by side.
 *
 * The suffix and the `epubVersion` field are two sources of truth, held consistent by
 * `epub-version.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Controls
 *
 * The control for the six horizontal ailments is the healthy skeleton itself
 * (`baseSpec`), and the control for the three vertical ones is `vertical-japanese`.
 * `vertical-japanese` deliberately **does not declare** page-progression-direction, even
 * though real vertical Japanese books almost always are rtl — because to serve as a
 * control it has to differ from `ppd-rtl-vertical` by that one attribute alone.
 *
 * ## Why a named face
 *
 * Every fixture that needs predictable layout names `"Noto Serif CJK JP"`, writing
 * neither a generic family nor a generic as fallback. The three browsers do not agree on
 * CJK resolution for generic families (#4), and with a generic what gets measured is
 * "which font the browser picked" rather than "how this book lays out". Real books mostly
 * declare generics, which is #4's territory and must not contaminate the controllability
 * of the synthetic fixtures.
 */

 * A plate **taller than one page**, wrapped in a div that declares no height.

 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="pic"><span><img src="…"/></span></div>
 * ```
 * ```css
 * .pic { text-align: center; margin: 1.5em auto; width: 98% }
 * .pic img { max-width: 100% }
 * ```
 *
 * The book itself only handles the **inline axis** (`max-width`), leaving the block axis
 * uncapped — which is exactly the gap frond's `cap-overflowing-boxes` is supposed to fill.
 * But `max-block-size: 100%` **will not resolve** in this shape: a percentage max-height
 * needs a definite containing-block size, and `.pic` is `height: auto`, so the whole
 * declaration is treated as `none` and the image stretches past and is clipped by
 * `overflow: hidden` (`src/renderer/layout.ts` has the measured numbers).
 *
 * **The wrapper is the point of this fixture, not decoration.** The same mechanism holds
 * when the image sits directly under `<body>` (layout.ts sets body's block-size to auto),
 * but that would lose the real-world shape of "the book wrapped it itself", and were the
 * fix ever changed to "only handle body's direct children", an unwrapped fixture would
 * pass while real books stayed broken.
 *
 * The image's aspect ratio is deliberately extreme (64 × 720), with a dark band at the very
 * bottom: when the lower half is clipped, that band disappears from the screen, which is
 * visible at a glance when reading the screenshots.

 * A `<script>` and an `<iframe>` between two paragraphs of the **body**.

 *
 * Measured over 34 books in circulation (1638 sections): `<script>` in `<body>` is **0**,
 * and so are `<iframe>` / `<object>` / `<embed>` / `<frame>` and `on*` attributes. The 1456
 * `<script>` elements that do exist are all in `<head>`, all one shape (the Kobo toolchain's
 * `<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/kobo.js"/>`), and removing something from
 * `<head>` shifts no CFI an annotation could be pointing at.
 *
 * ## What it holds
 *
 * `stripScriptedContent` (ADR-0006) empties those elements **where they stand** rather than
 * removing them, so that the node count is left alone — as every other intervention leaves
 * it (`link.replaceWith(style)` is 1:1, frond's own two `<style>` elements only append to
 * `<head>`). Removing one would shift the CFI index of every following sibling by two, and
 * the symptom of that is a reader's highlight silently landing somewhere else (#65).
 *
 * So this file exists to make that **visible to a test** (`isolation.spec.ts`'s "emptying in
 * place leaves every CFI where the book put it"), not because the shape was measured. The
 * two elements sit **between** paragraphs rather than at the end for exactly that reason: at
 * the end there is no following sibling, and a shift would have nothing to show.
 *
 * The script is written inline rather than with a `src`: a `src` would need a resource in the
 * manifest, and "this book carries an extra resource" is a second axis this file must not
 * grow (`single-ailment.test.ts`).
