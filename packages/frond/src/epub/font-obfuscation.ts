/**
 * Obfuscated fonts — the book scrambles the first few bytes of a font file so it
 * cannot be used as a standalone font. **This is not encryption**: the algorithm is
 * public and the key is written in the book itself (it is the book's own unique
 * identifier); the point is embedding licences, not secrecy.
 *
 * Which items are obfuscated, and with which scheme, is declared in
 * `META-INF/encryption.xml`.
 *
 * ## The support boundary: only the IDPF scheme
 *
 * | Algorithm | URI | frond |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | IDPF (defined by the EPUB spec itself) | `http://www.idpf.org/2008/embedding` | decodes it |
 * | Adobe | `http://ns.adobe.com/pdf/enc#RC` | **explicit error** |
 * | Anything else (real encryption, e.g. DRM) | — | **explicit error** |
 *
 * The two schemes differ in both key derivation and length (IDPF: SHA-1 over the
 * whitespace-stripped identifier gives 20 bytes, masking the first 1040; Adobe: read
 * the UUID inside the identifier as hex into 16 bytes, masking the first 1024), so
 * using one to decode the other **always** yields broken bytes rather than something
 * approximately right.
 *
 * **The state of the evidence has to be stated plainly: this project has obtained no
 * evidence about obfuscated fonts at all.** Not one of the 33 sample books has a
 * `META-INF/encryption.xml`, and none embeds fonts either — so "which scheme is more
 * common" is neither confirmed nor refuted here. This boundary is drawn from the
 * spec, not from measured numbers. That is the same discipline ADR-0010 applies to
 * `primary-writing-mode`: with no evidence, say there is none rather than pretend
 * otherwise.
 *
 * **What it would take to overturn this**: a book using the Adobe scheme. At that
 * point what needs adding is the key derivation and the length, plus a new synthetic
 * fixture (ADR-0007: one ailment per file) — not the removal of the error here.
