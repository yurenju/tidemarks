/**
 * The TOC — a book's table of contents: a hierarchy of titles paired with locations
 * (CONTEXT.md).
 *
 * **The TOC is the concept; the navigation document is the file carrying it**, and
 * frond supports two vehicles: EPUB 3's `nav.xhtml` and EPUB 2's `toc.ncx`. This
 * module reads both into the same tree, so a consumer's table-of-contents code does
 * not need two versions (user story 14).
 *
 * The two vehicles express the same tree in different shapes, and go wrong in
 * different ways:
 *
 * | | `nav.xhtml` | `toc.ncx` |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Label and location | one `<a>` carries both | `<navLabel><text>` and `<content src>` are two child elements |
 * | Hierarchy | the `<ol>` opens **inside** the `<li>` | a navPoint nests directly in a navPoint |
 *
 * So the two collect functions below stand alone — merging them into one generic
 * "recursively find labels" implementation would lose two things at once: `<a>`
 * elements outside the `<nav>` (landmarks) would be gathered into the TOC, and a
 * navigation document that puts its sub-list in the wrong place (as a sibling of the
 * `<li>` rather than inside it) would silently flatten.
 *
 * ## hrefs go through the same normalization as the manifest
 *
 * Every item's href is handed to `resolveHref()`, with the **navigation document
 * itself** as the base position in the archive — not the package document's position;
 * the two are not necessarily in the same directory (`toc-href-parent-prefix`). The
 * `%2c` and `../` ailments are therefore handled by one shared implementation, and
 * there is no string manipulation here at all.

/**
 * Which file carries this book's TOC. The order follows ADR-0010's "priority of
 * navigation documents":
 *
 * 1. When 3.x is declared, `properties="nav"` wins and the NCX is ignored entirely
 * 2. When 2.x is declared, the NCX is the only route
 * 3. When 3.x is declared but no nav is found, **fall back to the NCX** rather than
 *    throwing
 *
 * "Found" includes **that item actually being in the archive**: a navigation document
 * that is declared but whose file is missing lands in the same case as one that was
 * never declared (what is missing is the table of contents, not content), so this
 * keeps looking rather than throwing.
 *
 * ## The two ways to point at an NCX
 *
 * `<spine toc>` is the package document's formal way of pointing at an NCX, but
 * **books do not always write it**: all 33 books declare an NCX in their manifest,
 * and only 27 point at it with `<spine toc>` — the other 6 can only be found by media
 * type. All 6 have a nav, so rule 3 is never actually reached for them, but without
 * the media type fallback a book that "declares 3.x, has no nav, and never points at
 * its NCX" would have no table of contents, and every component of that is normal in
 * the wild.
 *
 * The media type is not inventing a fourth rule: ADR-0010 says which vehicle wins, and
 * says nothing about how to recognise it in the manifest, and
 * `application/x-dtbncx+xml` is the NCX's registered media type — no book will have a
 * second candidate. (`tests/node/support/epub-archive.ts` deliberately does **not**
 * implement this fallback, for the opposite reason: that layer reads fixtures we
 * generate ourselves, and being lenient would mean nothing turns red when the
 * generator forgets to write `<spine toc>`.)

/**
 * Which `<nav>` inside `nav.xhtml` is the TOC.

 * `xml.ts`, so the attribute name is `type`). Measured: of the 31 books that have a
 * nav, **27 have more than one `<nav>` in their navigation document** (usually also
 * landmarks and a page-list), and all 31 declare `epub:type` on the TOC one. An
 * implementation taking the first `<nav>` as the TOC stands a chance of picking up a
 * different list in those 27.
 *
 * ## The declared one is looked for at any depth; the fallback is not
 *
 * The two steps ask different questions on purpose.
 *
 * The declared `<nav>` is searched for **anywhere below `<body>`**, because the spec
 * puts no constraint there: "there are no restrictions on the structure or content of
 * the EPUB navigation document outside of the specialized navigation elements", and the
 * requirement is that the document *include* exactly one `toc` nav — the restrictions
 * that follow govern that element's own content model and its descendants, never its
 * ancestors. This was originally written as "a direct child of `<body>`" on a measured
 * 31/31, and it took **one book outside that sample** to break: the EPUB 3 sample
 * publication `草枕` wraps its perfectly conforming `<nav epub:type="toc">` in a
 * `<section epub:type="frontmatter">`, and frond read that book's table of contents as
 * empty (ADR-0007's second layer, #35). The measurement was not wrong; it was a
 * measurement of 31 books, and the shape it did not contain is legal.
 *
 * The fallback — the book declared no `epub:type` anywhere — stays a **direct child of
 * `<body>`**, and that asymmetry is the point. Without a declaration there is nothing
 * to distinguish the table of contents from any other list, and a navigation document
 * may be part of the linear reading order, so recursing at this step would let a `<nav>`
 * belonging to the prose become the TOC. Not one book in the sample reaches this branch;
 * it is kept for books not yet measured, and it should stay the conservative one.
