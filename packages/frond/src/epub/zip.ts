/**
 * A ZIP reader, just enough to read an OCF (EPUB) container.
 *
 * ## Why not a library
 *
 * frond ships with **zero runtime dependencies**. This module replaces
 * `fflate.unzipSync`, and the reason it is only two hundred lines is that
 * **decompression itself is not hand-written**:
 * `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` is built into the platform, present in Node
 * and all three browsers (`tests/browser/smoke/decompression-stream.spec.ts` is the
 * tripwire on that assumption). What is left for this file is parsing the container
 * format, and that is a set of fixed-length fields.
 *
 * Replacing it fixed something along the way: `unzipSync` is synchronous, and opening
 * a 34 MB book locks the main thread for nearly a hundred milliseconds. Here
 * decompression happens off the JS thread and overlaps in batches, which measures
 * faster than the synchronous version.
 *
 * ## Read from the central directory, do not scan local headers
 *
 * Both routes reach the entries. The difference is that a local header's length
 * fields **are allowed to lie** — a writer compressing as it writes (streaming) does
 * not yet know the compressed length when it writes the local header, so it puts 0 in
 * three fields and the real values follow the data in a data descriptor (bit 3 of the
 * general purpose flag). The central directory has no such problem: it is written
 * last, and every field there is final. **Reading the central directory makes the
 * data descriptor automatically not a case to handle**, rather than a branch to
 * remember to write.
 *
 * ## Whatever is explicitly unsupported throws rather than guesses
 *
 * ZIP64, encryption, compression methods other than deflate, multi-volume archives.
 * In the sample (34 books, 3309 entries) **not one** of these four appears — ZIP64
 * only comes into play past 4 GB or 65535 entries. What they have in common is that
 * the cost of guessing wrong is **inflating a pile of garbage that looks like data**,
 * which flows all the way to the screen as mojibake or broken images, with nobody
 * able to trace the root cause back here. Better to not open at all.
 *
 * One more thing is deliberately not done: **entry names are not path-sanitised**. A
 * name starting with `../` is accepted here, because frond never uses it to write a
 * file — it is only a key in a table, and the lookup side (`resource-path.ts`'s
 * `resolveHref`) already rejects hrefs that escape the package root. Blocking it a
 * second time here would turn that book from "one resource points outside the
 * package" into "the whole book will not open", and those are two different things.
