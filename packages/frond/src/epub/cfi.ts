/**
 * The **grammar layer** of EPUB CFI (Canonical Fragment Identifier): the round trip
 * between string and structure, plus ordering two CFIs.
 *
 * A CFI is an exact position or range within a book (CONTEXT.md), and it is what
 * locates a reader's progress and their annotations.
 *
 * CONTEXT.md says "a CFI is exact but not orderable by magnitude; a fraction is
 * orderable but coarse" — that sentence is about **distance**: there is no "how far
 * apart" between two CFIs, and no percentage to compute, which is what fractions are
 * for. **Which comes first is still answerable**, and has to be (user story 22:
 * ordering annotations by their place in the book). So there is a `compareCfi()` here
 * and no subtraction anywhere.
 *
 * ## This module's boundary
 *
 * **Mapping a CFI onto a position is not here.** Walking a CFI down to a node, or
 * writing a position out as a CFI, means counting nodes, handling ones that do not
 * count, and merging adjacent text — that is `cfi-tree.ts`, next door.
 *
 * This header used to say that half "needs an actually rendered document", and put it
 * in `Renderer` on that basis. It measured the wrong thing: what it needs is a
 * **tree**, and a rendered document merely happens to be one, so the whole of it now
 * sits at this layer too (ADR-0012). What genuinely needs a browser is `Range` itself,
 * and that is all `renderer/cfi-dom.ts` still holds.
 *
 * The cut between this module and that one is unchanged: string ↔ structure here,
 * structure ↔ nodes there, and neither knows what the other is doing. What that buys
 * is that both sit at the base of the test pyramid — zero DOM, Vitest in Node
 * (ADR-0009).
 *
 * ## The oracle is the spec, not foliate
 *
 * This layer's correctness is measured against the EPUB CFI specification; foliate has
 * no special knowledge here (layer 1 of ADR-0001's test pyramid). Its
 * `tests/epubcfi-tests.js` was run once as an **acceptance table**, and the
 * entry-by-entry results are recorded in
 * `tests/node/cfi/foliate-acceptance.test.ts` — that is reading its cases, not
 * reading its code.
 *
 * ## The grammar (the spec's ABNF, keeping only what this layer needs)
 *
 * ```
 * fragment   = "epubcfi(" ( path | range ) ")"
 * range      = path "," local_path "," local_path
 * path       = { step | "!" } [ offset ]
 * step       = "/" integer [ "[" assertion "]" ]
 * offset     = ":" integer [ "[" assertion "]" ]
 * ```
 *
 * `!` is an **indirection**: crossing it switches to a different document (package
 * document → content document). So a path is represented here as "several segments
 * split by `!`" (`CfiSegment`) rather than one flat run of steps — that boundary is
 * the only place compare ever answers "incomparable".

 * Which of two CFIs comes first in the book (user story 22: ordering annotations by

 * position falling inside someone else's range therefore still gets an order rather
 * than "incomparable":
 *
 * - The point is **after** the range's start (the range has already begun) → the point
 *   sorts after the range, decided by the start alone
 * - The point is **exactly on** the range's start → the starts match, so compare ends;

 * would turn one position into two different positions just because the book got a new
 * edition.

 *
 * When the two make incompatible claims about the **same node**, this layer has no way

 *
 * - One crosses into a different document at that node (`!`) while the other keeps
 *   walking into its children. The two positions lie in different documents, and the
 *   order between documents is not something this string can state.
 * - One lands in that node's text (`:N`) while the other lands on one of its children.
 *   Which comes first depends on where that child sits in the content, and that takes
 *   a document to know.
 *
 * Both need `Renderer` to have parsed the document before there is an answer, so at
 * the grammar layer they are `"incomparable"`, not `"equal"`.
