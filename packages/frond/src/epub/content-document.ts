/**
 * One section of a book, read as text and pointed back into — **without a browser**.
 *
 * This is what the tree layer is for. A consumer holding a book's bytes and nothing else can
 * now answer both directions of the question a reading position asks:
 *
 * - *what is the reader looking at* — a stored CFI comes in, a stretch of this section's text
 *   comes out
 * - *where is this passage* — a stretch of text goes in, a CFI comes out, and it addresses
 *   the same place the browser would have written
 *
 * The second direction is the one that was impossible before, and it is the one that matters
 * for writing anything back: a note has to be anchored, and an anchor is a CFI.
 *
 * ## Character offsets, not node offsets
 *
 * The unit on this interface is "the Nth character of this section's text", counted by the
 * same traversal the whole-book index uses (`text-nodes.ts`). That is deliberate: node
 * offsets are a property of one parser's tree, and this whole module exists because two
 * parsers produce trees that differ in small ways. Character offsets into the flattened text
 * are the thing both of them agree on, and they are also what a consumer can actually work
 * with — searching for a passage is `indexOf`, not a tree walk.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not paginate, measure, or lay anything out. A **page** is a product of layout, and
 * layout needs a browser (CONTEXT.md); nothing here can say which characters share a screen.
 * A consumer that needs that has to be told by whatever is rendering.
