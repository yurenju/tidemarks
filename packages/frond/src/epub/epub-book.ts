 * The consumer supplies bytes and receives the title, language, readingOrder and
 * cover — decompression, the container format, where the package document is and how
 * hrefs resolve all live in here, so a bookshelf never has to know what an EPUB looks
 * like (#8).
 *
 * **Zero DOM dependency** (ADR-0005): this class and every module beneath it touch
 * neither `document`, nor `DOMParser`, nor any browser object, so it runs in Node and
 * its tests therefore sit at the base of the test pyramid (ADR-0009, Vitest).
 *
 * ## Why `open()` rather than `new EpubBook(bytes)`
 *
 * Getting bytes out of a `File` or `Blob` requires async, and a constructor cannot be
 * async. The factory method makes "holding an instance" and "this book opens" the
 * same thing — there is no such thing as a half-opened `EpubBook`: when it will not
 * open, `open()` throws `EpubOpenError` and the instance never comes into existence.
