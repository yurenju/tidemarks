/**
 * The OCF container — an EPUB's outer shell: a ZIP, plus a
 * `META-INF/container.xml` saying where the package document is.
 *
 * This layer is its own module because it is the **only place that knows a book is
 * an archive**. Every layer above it sees nothing but a "path → bytes" table, so the
 * decompression implementation (today `zip.ts` inflating everything into memory) can
 * be swapped for streaming or range requests without touching a line of the parsing
 * code.
 *
 * `openContainer` is async because decompression is — `DecompressionStream` has no
 * synchronous form (`zip.ts`). **Only the moment of opening is async**: the bytes are
 * all inflated into the table right here, so `bytes()` and `text()` stay synchronous
 * and the four parsing modules above them need not change a line.
 *
 * Zero DOM dependency (ADR-0005): `DecompressionStream` and `URL` are both standard
 * WHATWG objects, present in Node and in all three browsers.
