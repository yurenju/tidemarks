/**
 * The public face of the `EpubBook` layer — the lower half of ADR-0005's two-layer
 * split: pure TypeScript, zero DOM.
 *
 * Consumers only need what is in this file: opening a book, metadata, readingOrder,
 * the cover, and the errors raised when it will not open. `container.ts` /
 * `package-document.ts` / `xml.ts` are implementation and are not on the public
 * face — their shape will still move over the next few issues.
