/**
 * Maps an `href` in a book to an entry name inside the archive.
 *
 * **This is the one and only route in the project.** The manifest (`resources.ts`),
 * the container's `full-path` (`container.ts`) and the TOC (`toc.ts`) all call this
 * function, each swapping in a different base: resolution is relative to the document
 * that cites the href. Spine's original sin was exactly this — the same
 * normalization implemented twice, each unaware of the other, so fixing one left the
 * other broken (#1). One more call site is not duplication; one more
 * `decodeURIComponent` is.
 *
 * **This is not string concatenation.** An `href` is a URL, not a filesystem path,
 * and has to be resolved by URL rules relative to the document citing it. Evidence
 * (from the comments on #8): a Kobo-channel EPUB 3 whose OPF sits at
 * `OEBPS/content.opf` has this in its manifest
 *
 * ```xml
 * <item id="js-kobo.js" href="../js/kobo.js" media-type="application/javascript"/>
 * ```
 *
 * and `js/kobo.js` really does exist at the package root. Joining `OEBPS/` to
 * `../js/kobo.js` gives the literal `OEBPS/../js/kobo.js`, which is not the name of
 * any ZIP entry, so a concatenating implementation judges this **conforming book** to
 * have an OPF pointing at a missing file.
 *
 * Borrowing WHATWG `URL`'s resolution rules (zero DOM dependency; Node and browsers
 * both have it) handles `../` and percent-encoding at once — the latter being a
 * separate ailment (`toc-href-percent-comma`).
 *
 * ## Why a sentinel directory
 *
 * `URL` swallows surplus `..` at the root: `../../x` relative to `/OEBPS/a.opf`
 * resolves to `/x` rather than failing. That is precisely what would make "escapes
 * the package root" — non-conforming, and also the shape of a path traversal —
 * invisible. So the base is padded with one sentinel directory: whatever still sits
 * under the sentinel after resolution is inside the package, and whatever had that
 * level swallowed has escaped.
