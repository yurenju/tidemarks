/**
 * The small amount of XML the EPUB packaging format requires.
 *
 * **No `DOMParser`**: `EpubBook` has zero DOM dependency (ADR-0005), and that is
 * exactly why it can run in Node and be tested at the base of the test pyramid.
 *
 * **No XML library either**: frond ships with zero runtime dependencies. This module
 * replaces `fast-xml-parser`, and the reason it is barely longer than the adapter
 * layer it replaced is that the old layer was almost entirely translating the
 * parser's representation (`:@`, `#text`, the `@_` prefix) back into the three
 * questions wanted here: child elements, attributes, text. Parsing it ourselves makes
 * that whole translation disappear.
 *
 * The dialect to be read is narrow — narrow enough to enumerate: tags, attributes,
 * text, CDATA, comments, processing instructions, skipping DOCTYPE, the five
 * predefined entities and numeric character references. The 1767 XML documents in the
 * sample use nothing beyond that.
 *
 * ## Well-formedness and parsing are one pass
 *
 * The old implementation had to call `XMLValidator` once and then `XMLParser` again,
 * because that parser is very forgiving of malformed input (one missing end tag
 * silently swallows an entire subtree). Writing it ourselves removes that crack — the
 * place that is malformed is the place parsing stops, and a broken book always gets
 * "this book is broken" rather than "that field would not read". That silent failure
 * is the whole reason this layer exists.
 *
 * ## Namespace prefixes are always stripped
 *
 * The `dc` in `dc:title` is just a prefix this document chose for itself, and the XML
 * spec allows a book to write any string (the binding is what carries the meaning).
 * An implementation matching prefixes literally would fail to read the title of a
 * book that declares it as `d:`, and that book is entirely conforming. With prefixes
 * stripped, `dc:title`, `opf:role` and `xml:lang` become `title`, `role` and `lang`.
 * `xmlns` and `xmlns:*` themselves are discarded entirely — they declare bindings,
 * not what this document is talking about.
 *
 * ## Document order has to be preserved
 *
 * The order of mixed content must not be lost: `<a>前<span>言</span>後</a>` has to
 * read back as `前言後`. That is not fastidiousness, it is measured: across the local
 * set of books, 73 of the navigation documents' 1527 TOC links have **titles carrying
 * inline tags** (5 books), and in one of them (《我的公寓》) **all 39 TOC entries have
 * their text wrapped in a `<span>`** — an implementation reading only the node's own
 * level of text would give that book an empty string for every TOC title. Another
 * book's second level is `<span><small>輯一</small>・儲藏室</span>`, and losing the
 * order turns that title into `・儲藏室輯一`. Both are silent errors: the TOC length
 * is right, the hrefs are right, only the words are broken.

 * content document asks a different question: "what is the third node under this parent",
 * text nodes included and in order. That is what CFI counts (`cfi-tree.ts`), and it cannot
 * be reconstructed from the query interface.
 *
 * The shape is the DOM's, so the addressing walk runs here unmodified — see
 * `tree.ts`. Two consequences of this parser are worth naming, because both are places
 * where a browser's tree looks different and the addressing rule absorbs it:
 *
 * - **Comments and processing instructions are not in the tree at all.** A browser keeps
 *   them; CFI does not count them, and does not let them break a run of text in two, so both
 *   trees address identically.
 * - **A run of text is one node even where it contains entity references.** A browser's XML
 *   parser often leaves several adjacent text nodes there. Adjacent text merges into a
 *   single chunk before anything is numbered, so again both trees agree.
