/**
 * SHA-1, doing exactly one thing: hashing bytes into 20 bytes.
 *
 * ## Why it is hand-written
 *
 * IDPF font obfuscation derives its key from the book's unique identifier, and the
 * first step of that derivation is SHA-1 (`src/epub/font-obfuscation.ts`). Neither
 * of the platform's ready-made routes works:
 *
 * - **WebCrypto (`crypto.subtle.digest`)** only exists in a secure context in the
 *   browser. A reader opened over `http://` gets `crypto.subtle === undefined`, and
 *   a book with obfuscated fonts renders as tofu from cover to cover — and frond
 *   does not get to decide which origin it is deployed on. It is also async, which
 *   would stain "take the bytes of a resource", a synchronous operation, into a
 *   Promise all the way down.
 * - **`node:crypto`** only exists in Node. `EpubBook` has to run on both sides
 *   (ADR-0005).
 *
 * The third benefit of writing it by hand is the same one that motivates the
 * hand-written CRC32 in `src/test-fixtures/zip.ts`: this project's correctness
 * should not depend on how some implementation behaves in some environment.
 *
 * **It is not encryption and serves no security requirement.** IDPF obfuscation is
 * a public algorithm whose key is written inside the book itself; the point is to
 * keep the font from being usable as a standalone file, not to keep it secret. So
 * nothing here needs (or should claim) constant time or any side-channel resistance.
 *
 * Correctness is pinned entry by entry against `node:crypto` in
 * `tests/node/sha1.test.ts` — that is an independent implementation, and only using
 * it as an oracle guards against the all-green illusion where the generator and the
 * library share one wrong hash and therefore agree with each other.
 *
 * ## Why it lives under src/ rather than in epub/ or test-fixtures/
 *
 * Both sides need it: the library de-obfuscates, the fixture generator **creates**
 * obfuscation (`epub.ts`). Putting it on either side would make the other depend
 * backwards, and it depends on nothing itself.
