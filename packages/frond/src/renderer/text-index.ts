/**
 * The DOM-typed face of `src/epub/text-nodes.ts`.

 * all live down there — none of that needs a browser, and a Worker reading the same section
 * as bytes has to walk it identically or a reader's note lands in the wrong paragraph.
 *
 * What is here is the DOM's vocabulary: taking `Document` and giving back `Text`, so
 * `section-view.ts` and `renderer.ts` keep measuring rectangles on the type they already
 * hold. `document.body` is also taken from the DOM rather than searched for, because the DOM
 * already answers that question authoritatively.
