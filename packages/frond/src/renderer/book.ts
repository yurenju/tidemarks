/**
 * What `Renderer` requires of "a book", plus one in-memory implementation.
 *
 * ## Why `Renderer` does not consume `EpubBook` directly
 *
 * ADR-0002 explicitly requires frond to **provide its own fake / in-memory
 * implementation and treat it as part of the public API** — a layer above testing its
 * own integration code should not be forced to build doubles. This interface is where
 * that sentence lands: `EpubBook` satisfies it structurally (pinned at the type level
 * by `tests/node/renderer/book.test.ts`), and `MemoryBook` is another implementation
 * that satisfies it.
 *
 * Narrowing the interface buys a second thing, and in this repo that thing is concrete:
 * `Renderer`'s dependencies therefore **exclude decompression and XML parsing**. When
 * the browser tests feed frond into a page, the module graph has no bare specifier to
 * resolve, so the whole test suite needs no bundler
 * (`tests/browser/support/harness.ts`). That is no coincidence — the `EpubBook` layer
 * has nothing to do with rendering to begin with, and would only be dragged in because
 * the types were tied together.
 *
 * ## The types here are structural, not imported from `EpubBook`
 *
 * Importing `Section` and `Resource` directly would make this interface follow every
 * extension of `EpubBook`, and fields `Renderer` never uses (`properties`, the manifest
 * id) would become obligations on the fake. So what is written here is **the few slots
 * rendering actually needs**, with a separate type assertion ensuring `EpubBook` still
 * satisfies it — any drift turns `npm run typecheck` red rather than showing up at
 * runtime.
