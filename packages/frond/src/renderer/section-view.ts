/**
 * One section's view: an iframe, plus the measurement and scrolling of the document
 * inside it.
 *
 * One iframe per section (ADR-0006). There is barely a choice here — EPUB stylesheets
 * make heavy use of global selectors such as `body`, `p` and `*`, and Shadow DOM cannot
 * hold back pollution at that level; and pagination needs a real document to carry
 * `writing-mode` and multi-column.
 *
 * ## The margin is outside the iframe, not in the book's CSS
 *
 * The reader's margin is achieved by **insetting the iframe within its container**,
 * rather than injecting padding into the book. The difference is more than an
 * implementation preference: padding on the multi-column container makes the first column
 * start at a different place from the rest, so "one page turn = one page stride" no longer
 * holds (foliate has to track an extra `contentStart` for this). Insetting the iframe
 * leaves the document entirely unaware the margin exists — the stride is a clean whole
 * number, and the book's cascade never has to fight frond over `body`'s padding (spine
 * hung a MutationObserver that is never released to fight for that one slot).

   *
   * A document loads into the iframe long before it is paginated: the layout stylesheet is

   * `document.fonts.ready`. Painted during that gap, the section is an **ordinary

   * size, a native scrollbar down the side (in the platform's own colours, not the
   * reader's theme), scrolled to the top of the section rather than to the position that
   * is about to be restored.
   *
   * The gap is as long as the fonts take. Measured in spine with a 16.7 MB CJK face
   * already on the device: **680 ms**, on every open of the book, because applying the
   * face rebuilds the section (`renderer.ts`'s `applySettings`).
   *
   * The reveal is the renderer's to call rather than something `mount()` does at the end,
   * because pagination is not the last step that moves the content: `applyAnchor` scrolls
   * to the page the reader was on. Revealing before it would trade a flash of unpaginated
   * text for a flash of page 1.

   * Without it the frame is painted into the page's own layer, and moving it repaints every
   * pixel it covers **on every frame of the drag** — a full-screen repaint per `pointermove`.
   * Measured over seven turns in Chromium: **298 paints, and 60 with this**.

   * phone that pays, and paint flashing in devtools that shows it.
   *
   * ## Why it is raised and lowered rather than left on
   *
   * **WebKit's hit-testing goes wrong while it stands.** With `will-change` declared at mount,
   * five of frond's own input tests fail there — a tap at real coordinates stops reaching the
   * document inside the frame, which on a phone is a book that cannot be tapped or turned. A
   * turn is the only time the frame moves, and during one the pointer is already captured by
   * the frame the press began in, so the window where hit-testing matters and the window where
   * the layer stands do not overlap.
   *
   * It is also what `will-change` is for: the standard says to declare it shortly before the
   * change and to take it away afterwards, because a layer costs memory for as long as it
   * stands — and frond holds three frames, not one.
