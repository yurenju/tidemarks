/**
 * Every textual rewrite made to a book's stylesheets. **This module does not touch the
 * DOM**; its input and output are both CSS strings.
 *
 * Each rewrite corresponds to one entry in ADR-0003's intervention list, and the reasons
 * live with that list in `interventions.ts` — only the mechanism is here. They are kept
 * apart because they change at different rates: the mechanism changes when new browser
 * behaviour is measured, the list changes when a trade-off changes, and mixing them
 * would scatter the question "why is frond allowed to touch the book's declarations"
 * across the codebase.
 *
 * ## Why a hand-written pass rather than regular expressions
 *
 * CSS declarations are not line-oriented: a `;` may appear inside a string or a `url()`,
 * a comment may be spliced into the middle of a property name, and an `@media` block
 * contains rules rather than declarations. Regular expressions get all three wrong, and
 * the form the failure takes is **silently corrupting a book's stylesheet** — nobody
 * receives an error message, they just see a broken layout.
 *
 * So this walks the text itself, recognising only four things: comments, strings,
 * parentheses, and the `{` `}` `;` separators. It is not a CSS parser (selectors and
 * at-rule preludes are always carried over verbatim), it is a **declaration locator** —
 * enough to answer "is this stretch of text a declaration, and what is its property
 * name", and that is exactly all any of the rewrites need.

/**
 * Expands `@import`ed stylesheets **in place**, recursively all the way down.
 *
 * ## Why rewriting the `@import`'s address to `blob:` is not enough
 *
 * Two independent reasons, and four books in the sample walk into both:
 *
 * 1. **The string form is not a `url()` at all.** `@import "style-standard.css";`
 *    contains no `url(`, so `rewriteUrls` does not touch one character of it. Relative
 *    paths always fail to resolve under `blob:` (`document-source.ts`'s header), so that
 *    stylesheet **disappears entirely**. Four books (九歌112年散文選, 創業投資聖經,
 *    原子習慣, 大器可以晚成, all from the same Kadokawa/BookCreator toolchain) have
 *    content documents that only `<link>` a single `book-style.css`, and that file
 *    contains **nothing but `@import` strings** apart from an `@charset` — the entire
 *    typographic intent lives in the imported files. The symptom is all four vertical
 *    books laying out horizontally.
 *
 * 2. **`@import` loads asynchronously.** Even rewritten to `blob:`, frond measures the
 *    total content length to compute the page count immediately after the iframe's load
 *    event, and if the styles have not arrived what is measured is an unstyled layout —
 *    so the page count is wrong, and only when loading happens to be slow. The `<link>`
 *    case is already solved by inlining; `@import` follows the same reasoning.
 *
 * Expanding in place solves both at once: the cascade order is preserved verbatim (the
 * spec requires `@import` to precede all rules, so "splice at its original position" and
 * "treat as written there" are the same thing), and once the text is inside a `<style>`
 * there is no second network round trip to speak of.
 *
 * ## What will not expand is left verbatim
 *
 * `expand` returns `undefined` when the reference points outside the book
 * (`@import url(https://…)`), when the archive has no such file, or on a cycle. It is
 * left verbatim rather than deleted — deleting would hide from whoever is investigating
 * what the book actually asked for, and an unresolvable `@import` looks the same on
 * screen as not having one.
 *
 * The `layer()` and `supports()` forms are likewise left verbatim: both change the
 * cascade's layering and conditions, and "splicing the text in" cannot reproduce that.
 * Not one book in the sample has them, so implementing it would mean writing to the spec.

 * ## Why removing `!important` alone is not enough
 *
 * The reader's font size is set on `html` and carried down by inheritance. As soon as the
 * book writes an absolute value on any descendant (`p { font-size: 12px }`), that stretch
 * detaches from the inheritance chain — the reader raises the size to 24px and the body
 * text is still 12px. There is no `!important` involved here; **the absolute value
 * itself** is what blocks the reader.
 *
 * Converted to `rem`, every font size the book declares becomes "a multiple of what the
 * reader set": `12px` is 0.75×, `24px` is 1.5×. Adjusting the size scales the whole
 * document by the same factor, and **the book's own hierarchy of sizes is preserved
 * entirely** — headings are still larger than body text, in exactly the same proportion.
 *
 * ## Why `rem` rather than `em`
 *
 * `em` is relative to the parent, so nested absolute sizes would multiply: `p`'s 0.75×
 * under `span`'s 0.625× becomes 0.47×, where the book meant 0.625×. `rem` is always
 * relative to the root and does not multiply, so every proportion is identical before and
 * after conversion.
 *
 * ## The cost
 *
 * This is the **only entry on the list that changes a value the book declared**; all the
 * others merely add declarations or remove a flag. Put differently, the book's intent
 * that "this stretch is always 12px" genuinely goes unrealised — but that intent conflicts
 * directly with user story 42 (adjusting the reader's font size has to take effect), and
 * ADR-0003 has already resolved that in the reader's favour. What is preserved is the half
 * that can be: the **proportions** between sizes.
