/**
 * frond's own layer of CSS — the pagination mechanism itself.
 *
 * The first row of ADR-0003's example table is about exactly this: **books never declare
 * `column-width`, multi-column is the tool frond uses for pagination, and this layer of
 * CSS belongs to frond to begin with.** So every declaration in this module carries
 * `!important` without having to be weighed against the intervention threshold — they are
 * not overriding the book, they are laying a floor the book has no opinion about.
 *
 * The one exception is `font-feature-settings`, for the reason given below.
 *
 * It produces a string rather than manipulating the CSSOM directly, so that it can be
 * tested in Node (the base layer of ADR-0009).
