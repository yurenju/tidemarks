/**
 * Turning a section's bytes into a document an iframe can load.
 *
 * Content is served as same-origin `blob:` (ADR-0006), and that has one immediate
 * consequence: **`blob:` has no directory structure**. Every relative reference in the
 * book (images, stylesheets, fonts) fails to resolve under `blob:`, so references have to
 * be swapped for resolved addresses while the document is still text. This is not
 * intervening in the book's declarations — the target is still the same resource, only the
 * notation changes.
 *
 * ## Why stylesheets are inlined rather than turned into a blob: `<link>`
 *
 * A `<link>` loads **asynchronously**. Rewritten to blob: it is still asynchronous, so the
 * iframe's load event may precede the styles being applied — and frond measures the total
 * content length to compute the page count immediately after load. What gets measured is an
 * unstyled layout, so the page count is wrong, and only when loading happens to be slow.
 * Inlining into a `<style>` makes styles and document arrive together, and that timing
 * simply does not exist.
 *
 * The order is preserved verbatim (the `<style>` is spliced in wherever the `<link>` was),
 * because the cascade goes by order.

 * Empties everything inside the book that could run.

 * decision rather than a feature trade-off. The iframe has to carry `allow-scripts` for the
 * parent to receive events (WebKit bug 218086, reproduced in #7), so the sandbox cannot
 * stop scripts inside the book — this step is the only thing that can.
 *
 * Three things are dealt with together, and missing any one leaves the defence with a hole:
 *
 * 1. **`<script>`**, in any namespace. Using `getElementsByTagNameNS("*", …)` rather than
 *    `getElementsByTagName`: a `<script>` inside SVG is in a different namespace, and SVG
 *    is an entirely legal part of an EPUB content document.
 * 2. **`on*` event attributes**. Emptying only `<script>` leaves `<body onload="…">` open.
 * 3. **Nested browsing contexts** (`<iframe>` / `<object>` / `<embed>` / `<frame>`).
 *
 * The third is the easiest to miss and has the worst consequence: **a nested browsing
 * context inherits the parent's sandbox flags**, `allow-scripts` included; and frond serves
 * content as `blob:`, whose origin is the consuming app's own origin. So a script inside an
 * `<iframe src="ch2.xhtml">` or an `<object data="x.svg">` would **run with the app's
 * origin** — items 1 and 2 having never once been applied to that nested document, since
 * they only clean the outermost one.
 *
 * They are emptied rather than rewritten to a safe origin: EPUB 3 permits `<iframe>`, but
 * frond not supporting scripted content is a "will not do" set by ADR-0006 rather than a
 * "not yet", and to the reader an iframe whose content will not load is the same as no
 * iframe.
 *
 * ## Emptied, not removed — because a CFI is a sibling ordinal
 *
 * `element.remove()` would be the obvious spelling and is the wrong one. `childAt` in
 * `epub/cfi-tree.ts` numbers an element by its position **among its siblings**, so removing one
 * takes two off the index of everything after it. The damage runs both ways and is silent
 * either way: frond's own CFIs stop meaning what other readers think they mean, and a CFI
 * written elsewhere resolves inside frond to a **different sentence** rather than failing.
 * Progress and annotations are stored as CFIs, so that is the whole of what breaks (#65).
