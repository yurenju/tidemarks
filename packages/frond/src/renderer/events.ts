 * One pointer press or release inside the iframe.
 *
 * ## Why raw down/up rather than a gesture event carrying `dx`/`dy`
 *
 * The iframe boundary blocks bubbling, so the consumer receives no pointer event at all
 * on the container — that is a gap at the fact layer, and frond should fill it. But the
 * way to fill it cannot be "frond works out how far you swiped for you": the moment frond
 * starts pairing down with up, handling multi-touch and deciding how many pixels count as
 * a swipe, it is consuming gestures, and ADR-0002 explicitly refuses that.
 *
 * So what is sent here is independent facts: at some moment, at some point in
 * container coordinates, a pointer went down (or moved, or went up, or was taken away), and
 * these two DOM conditions held at that instant. "This is a leftward swipe, therefore next
 * page" belongs to the consumer.
 *
 * ## `pointermove` is the same fact repeated, and it is what a turn in progress runs on
 *
 * A consumer dragging a page along with the finger needs the positions in between, and the
 * iframe boundary keeps every one of them from it. The position is reported **in the
 * container's coordinate system as the reader sees it**, which during a turn is not the same
 * as the iframe's own: the frame is being moved, and `clientX` inside a frame that has moved
 * 80px counts from the frame's new corner. frond adds that offset back, so a finger that has
 * not moved reports the same `x` twice — without it, dragging a page would be a feedback loop
 * against itself and the page would barely move at all.
 *
 * ## `pointercancel` exists because a gesture can end without a release
 *
 * The system takes the touch away — an edge swipe, a phone call, the browser deciding this is
 * its own gesture — and no `pointerup` follows. A consumer holding "a turn is in progress" has
 * nothing to close it with, and the page stays parked halfway across the screen for good.
 *
 * `linkactivate` is the precedent for the same shape: frond does not navigate itself, it
 * only says where that link points.
 *
 * ## Ordering relative to `linkactivate`
 *
 * On a press over a link, `pointerdown` → `pointerup` → `linkactivate` are sent in that
 * order. Which means that at the moment `pointerup` arrives it is not yet known whether a
 * `linkactivate` will follow — `isLink` exists for exactly this case: to let links take
 * precedence over page turns, look at it rather than waiting for the next event.

 * A pointer press, which carries one thing a release cannot: the press has not finished

 * ## Why the press needs a say at all
 *
 * A phone browser selects a word out of a plain tap on text, with no long press involved
 * — Chrome for Android's Touch to Search, which then raises a search bar over the book.
 * A reader tapping the edge to turn the page gets that bar, and no page turn is worth it.
 *
 * Undoing it afterwards does not work. The selection can be dropped through
 * `clearSelection()`, but the browser's own bar is not part of the document and no page
 * script can take it back down; by the time the consumer knows a tap happened, the bar is
 * already up. So the only moment where anything can be done is before the browser decides,
 * and this event is that moment.
 *
 * ## Why frond does not decide it
 *
 * Which presses the browser should not act on is policy: it depends on where the tap zones
 * are, on whether that consumer turns pages by tapping at all, and on the device (ADR-0002).
 * frond supplies the moment and the mechanism; the consumer supplies the "which".

   * frond does that by preventing the default of the `touchend` that ends the press. Which
   * mechanism to use was decided by measurement rather than by reading the documentation.
   * Chrome names unselectable text as a condition Touch to Search does not fire on, and
   * making the document unselectable for the press only made the bar **rarer** — 21% of
   * taps raised it anyway, against 72% with nothing at all. Cancelling the touch stopped it
   * outright, 0 times in 15, on an Android phone (#80).
   *
   * Four things follow:
   *
   * - It has to be called **synchronously** in the `pointerdown` listener. Later is after
   *   the browser has already decided.
   * - **The press loses its `click`**, and frond's link handling is built on that click, so
   *   `linkactivate` does not fire for a press that asked. `isLink` says whether that is
   *   about to matter, and a consumer whose tap zones lie over body text should read it.
   * - **Only a touch has this default to cancel.** For a mouse press the call does nothing.
   * - It says nothing about any other press. The answer is carried by the finger that asked,
   *   so a second finger on the screen neither takes it nor loses its own, and each press
   *   asks again.
   *
