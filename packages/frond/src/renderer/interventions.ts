/**
 * Every intervention frond makes in a book, registered one by one — the **closed list**
 * ADR-0003 requires.
 *
 * > Every one of frond's interventions is registered in a closed list and written down,
 * > and adding one requires stating why. The danger is not on day one but on day thirty:
 * > "we already override column-width anyway, might as well nudge line-height too", and
 * > six months later nobody remembers why the book's typography differs from what its
 * > author designed.
 *
 * So this list lives in the code rather than only in the documentation:
 * `interventions.test.ts` compares **set equality**, and one entry too many or too few
 * turns it red. Documentation drifts; tests do not.
 *
 * ## Four reasons, not two
 *
 * ADR-0003's prose says "only two situations qualify", but its table of examples
 * actually uses four. Telling them apart is necessary: the first two really do
 * **override the book**, the latter two do not, and mixing them together leaves "how
 * many things has frond overridden" unanswerable.
 *
 * | Reason | Overrides the book? | Basis in ADR-0003 |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `content-unreadable` | yes | prose reason 1: overflow clipped, overlap, blank pages |
 * | `reader-blocked` | yes | prose reason 2: the book uses `!important` to override the reader's choice |
 * | `frond-own-layer` | no | first row of the example table: books never declare `column-width`; the CSS used for pagination belongs to frond to begin with |
 * | `syntax-translation` | no | the prefix row of the example table: the browser did not do what the book said, and translating the declaration does not change the book's intent |
 *
 * Only the first two need to be weighed against the threshold. The latter two are
 * "frond doing its own job" and "restating the book's meaning to a browser that did not
 * understand it".

/**
 * ## Known gaps
 *
 * Registered in this comment rather than as an exported array: no code reads it, and
 * making it data would only put the same explanation in two places.
 *
 * Each entry is "we know it is there, and we know why we are not doing it now", not a
 * to-do list. **There are two kinds of reason, and telling them apart matters**:
 *
 * - **This shape was not measured in the sample** (entries 1 and 2). Doing something
 *   about what never once appeared in those books means writing to the spec rather than
 *   to what books actually look like (CONTEXT.md's "model books"). The right handling of
 *   this kind of gap is **to wait until it is measured** — and the postscript below
 *   records the lesson from applying that criterion wrongly once.
 * - **It was measured, but how to fix it is a trade-off decision** (entry 3). This kind
 *   of gap cannot be waved away with "not measured", so it carries an extra requirement:
 *   the status quo needs a fixture and a test holding it, so that someone knows if it
 *   changes.
 *
 * 1. **Absolute font sizes inside the `font` shorthand are not converted to `rem`.** The
 *    shorthand's value has to be taken apart to know which part is the size
 *    (`font: 12px/1.4 serif`), and taking it apart wrongly corrupts the whole
 *    declaration, which is worse than not converting. `!important` can still be removed
 *    (`demote-important`'s scope covers `font`), so all that still blocks the reader is
 *    "an absolute size in a shorthand without `!important`".
 *
 * 2. **`@import`'s `layer()` and `supports()` forms are not expanded.** Both change the
 *    cascade's layering and conditions, and the way frond expands `@import` is by
 *    splicing the text into its original position (`css.ts`'s `inlineImports`) — splicing
 *    cannot reproduce layering. That `@import` is left verbatim, and so is still loaded
 *    asynchronously. Not one book in the sample has it.
 *
 * 3. **Tables taller than one column have their lower half unreadable.** This entry
 *    differs from the others: **it was measured in the sample** (3 books, 9 sections, the
 *    worst clipped by 2563px), and `cap-overflowing-boxes` is a no-op against it — CSS
 *    specifies that `max-height` is a **lower** bound rather than an upper one for
 *    `display: table`, so a table is always as long as its content. And **Firefox does not
 *    break tables across adjacent columns** (Chromium and WebKit both do), so those rows
 *    extend past the container and are clipped by `overflow: hidden`; worse, not breaking
 *    across columns means the content does not extend along the inline axis, so the
 *    **section's page count becomes 1** and everything after the table becomes unreadable
 *    too.
 *
 *    The reason for not acting is not "not measured", it is that **this is a trade-off
 *    decision rather than a bug fix**: the remaining route is to replace `display: table`,
 *    after which every row becomes a block, content flows into adjacent columns and all of
 *    it is readable, at the cost of the table's alignment disappearing entirely. Which is
 *    better for the reader — "readable but misaligned" or "aligned but half invisible" —
 *    needs an issue to decide, not a choice made in passing while fixing a bug.
 *
 *    The status quo is held by a fixture plus a test (`table-taller-than-page`,
 *    `rendering.spec.ts`'s "a table taller than one column"), and the measurements and the
 *    three-way comparison are in `docs/browser-quirks.md`. When Firefox starts breaking
 *    tables that test turns red, and this entry can be removed then — in other words this
 *    gap may well disappear without frond changing at all, and that is exactly what
 *    "holding the status quo" buys.
 *
 * ## Postscript: what used to be entries 2 and 3 are no longer gaps
 *
 * "`@import`'s string form is not parsed" and "stylesheets brought in by `@import` load
 * asynchronously" were once registered here, on the criterion "this shape was not
 * measured in the sample". **That criterion was wrong at the time** — a later rendering
 * pass over 34 real books found four (九歌112年散文選, 創業投資聖經, 原子習慣,
 * 大器可以晚成, all from the same Kadokawa/BookCreator toolchain) whose content
 * documents only `<link>` an aggregator file consisting purely of `@import` strings, so
 * the entire stylesheet disappeared and all four vertical books laid out horizontally.
 *
 * This record is kept because the lesson is not in those two lines: **"not in the sample"
 * is an assertion to go and measure, not a conclusion that can be inferred.** That
 * registration rested on an impression that "the string form is rare in EPUB", and in the
 * sample it accounts for 12%.
 *
 * ## Postscript: what used to be entry 4 is no longer a gap either
 *
 * "`strip-scripted-content` shifts the CFI index of every sibling after what it removed" was
 * registered here on a third criterion — **it was measured, and the measurement is zero**.
 * Across 34 books in circulation (1638 sections), `<script>` in `<body>` is 0/1638, and so
 * are `<iframe>` / `<object>` / `<embed>` / `<frame>` and `on*` attributes. Every `<script>`
 * that exists is in `<head>` — 33 of the 34 books, 1456 of the 1638 sections (89%), all of
 * them the same shape (the Kobo toolchain's
 * `<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/kobo.js"/>`, followed by a `id="koboSpanStyle"`
 * `<style>`), injected by the retailer rather than written by the book. Removing from
 * `<head>` shifts nothing an annotation could point at: `<head>` is `/2` and `<body>` is
 * `/4`, and `<head>` itself stays. **The sample's subject bias belongs with the number**:
 * all 34 are Traditional or Simplified Chinese trade non-fiction, and the EPUBs that
 * genuinely use scripting are fixed-layout, children's books and textbooks — none of the
 * three in the sample. So the honest reading was "zero within trade non-fiction", not "zero
 * in EPUB".
 *
 * The gap is closed: the elements are now emptied where they stand rather than removed
 * (`document-source.ts`'s `emptyInPlace`), so the node count never changes and no CFI moves.
 * The zero is why there was no rush, but it was never a reason not to — ADR-0008 makes a
 * removal-shaped intervention a CFI-level breaking change, so the price of changing it rises
 * with every position a reader stores, and zero affected books is the cheapest that price
 * ever gets (#65). **A measurement of zero says the bill has not arrived yet; it does not
 * say the bill is small.**
