/**
 * Cuts the two public-domain books down to a size the repository can carry, and writes the
 * result to the monorepo's `tests/books/` (ADR-0007's second layer).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   FROND_PUBLIC_BOOK_SOURCES=/path/to/originals npm run trim:books
 *
 * The source directory holds the two files exactly as downloaded, under their upstream
 * names. **Those originals are not in the repository** — a second layer book is a
 * downloaded artifact rather than something a generator can reproduce, so what the
 * repository keeps is the trimmed result plus this script. This file is therefore the
 * machine-readable half of ADR-0007's "what was trimmed away"; the prose half is in the
 * ADR, and the two have to be changed together.
 *
 * ## Why the two books are trimmed differently
 *
 * The originals are 17.9 MB and 10.6 MB, and in both cases nearly all of that is one kind
 * of resource. But which kind, and what it costs to drop it, is not the same:
 *
 * - **Kusamakura** carries 18 MB of media-overlay narration in two MP3s. frond renders
 *   nothing from a media overlay, so dropping the audio costs no coverage at all. It also
 *   removes this book's only encumbered material: the publication is CC0, but those two
 *   MP3s alone are CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0, and a non-commercial clause does not belong in an MIT
 *   repository. Every chapter of the text is kept.
 *
 * - **Alice** carries 9.5 MB across 43 Tenniel illustrations, and those are not
 *   incidental: an illustrated real book is precisely the shape ADR-0007 says the
 *   synthetic fixtures cannot reach. So the illustrations are kept **at their original
 *   dimensions and bytes** — re-encoding or downscaling them would change whether a plate
 *   overflows a page, and "a plate taller than the page" is a defect this layer exists to
 *   find. The text is cut to chapters 1-3 instead, which is what makes the illustration
 *   count fall.
 *
 * ## Chapters 1-3 rather than some other slice
 *
 * The three of them run about 7,600 words — enough that every section paginates to many
 * pages in all three engines at the default type size, which is the axis the synthetic
 * prose cannot reach (most synthetic sections are a single page). They carry 8
 * illustrations plus the frontispiece, and chapter 3 holds the mouse's tail: a poem set as
 * a tapering shape, which is a real typographic structure no synthetic fixture has. All of
 * Standard Ebooks' front and back matter is kept, so the spine still opens and closes the
 * way a real book does.
 *
 * ## Keeping the package consistent
 *
 * Dropping a resource from an EPUB is never just dropping the file: the package document,
 * the navigation document, the NCX and the list of illustrations all point at it, and a
 * dangling pointer would turn this book into a test of our error handling rather than of
 * our rendering. Every removal below therefore states how many elements it expects to
 * take out, and `expect()` fails the run when the count does not match — an upstream
 * revision that renames a file should stop this script rather than quietly produce a book
 * with half its references hanging.
