# Runs Playwright over a set of **real, commercially circulating books**, to find the class of
# defect that is "all green on the synthetic fixtures, broken on real books" (CONTEXT.md's
# "model books").
#
# Usage:
#   FROND_BOOKS=/path/to/books npm run scan:books -- tests/browser/evidence/<name>.spec.ts
#   FROND_BOOKS=/path/to/books npm run scan:books -- tests/browser/evidence/<name>.spec.ts --project=webkit
#
# The books are named by `FROND_BOOKS` and mounted into the container at
# `tests/books/commercial` (already in `.gitignore`; ADR-0007: commercial books do not enter
# the repo). **A read-only mount rather than copying into the image** for two reasons: those
# books are copyrighted and should enter neither the build context nor the repo tree; and
# stuffing hundreds of MB of books into the image would mean repacking the context every time
# a line of a spec changes.
#
# One-off scanning specs go in `tests/browser/evidence/` (likewise gitignored, but `COPY . .`
# looks at the filesystem rather than git, so no commit is needed first).
