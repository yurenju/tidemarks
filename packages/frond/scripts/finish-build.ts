 * Which bare specifiers this package permits.

 * dependencies change, and it always rots in the direction of being too permissive —
 * nobody remembers to come back and narrow it after removing a dependency.
 *
 * Derived from the declarations, "what the shipped artifact imports" and "what package.json
 * says it depends on" become the same thing, and the moment the two drift, the build turns
 * red. For `@yurenju/frond` both are empty, so **the zero-dependency invariant maintains
 * itself** — it is no longer a special case hard-coded into this script.
 *
 * That shape is kept even though there is only one package left to check (frond-react is
 * gone; ADR-0008's revision). Hard-coding "no bare specifiers at all" would read the same
 * today and be wrong the first time a dependency is genuinely declared — the derivation
 * costs three lines and never needs revisiting.
 *
 * `devDependencies` do not count: those do not ship, and their appearance in `dist/` is a
 * defect.

/**
 * ## Why the `.d.ts` have to be rewritten by hand
 *
 * Inside `src/` everything imports everything else with a `.ts` extension (for the reason
 * see `tsconfig.json`), and `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` is responsible for swapping
 * them for `.js` on emit.
 *
 * **It only swaps them in the `.js` output, not in the `.d.ts` output** (measured on
 * TypeScript 7.0.2). So `dist/renderer/index.js` is right while the `index.d.ts` in the same
 * directory still says `export { Renderer } from "./renderer.ts"` — a file that does not
 * exist in `dist/`, and the consumer's type resolution breaks there. The symptom is hard to
 * recognise: the `import` works, and the types are `any`.
 *
 * So this makes that cut. The scope of the rewrite is narrow enough for string processing:
 * relative specifiers appear in the output in only one form, `from "…"` (there are no
 * `import("…")` type queries), and the invariant check below turns red if a new form
 * appears, rather than quietly missing it.
 */
const RELATIVE_TS_SPECIFIER = /(\bfrom\s*")(\.[^"]*)\.ts(")/g;

/**
 * Strips the lines that are entirely comment.
 *
 * ## Why this step is needed
 *
 * The two checks below run regular expressions over text, and tsc's emit **preserves
 * comments** — so a documentation comment like this gets treated as a real import:
 *
 *     /** ```ts
 *      * import { Renderer } from "@yurenju/frond/renderer";
 *      * ``` *\/
 *
 * The symptom is the build going red on a dependency that does not exist at all, and the fix
 * looks like "delete the examples from the documentation". That price cannot be paid: almost
 * all of this repo's public face explains itself through file-header comments.
 *
 * ## Why "entire line" is enough, without really parsing
 *
 * What is scanned is **the files tsc emitted**, not source written by a person. The emitted
 * shape is decided by a machine: every module specifier appears in an `import` / `export`
 * statement starting at column 0, and even a multi-line import only moves `} from "…"` onto
 * the next line — a line starting with `}`, not a comment. Conversely, preserved comments
 * are always lines starting with `//` or `*`.
 *
 * So a miss is impossible (a real import never grows on a comment line), and false positives
 * are blocked by this step. Doing better would take a parser that genuinely understands regex
 * literals and template literals, and that adds no protection for the two invariants guarded
 * here.
