# Third-party notices

This file covers material incorporated into the repository itself. It is
deliberately **not** shipped inside the tarball — `package.json`'s `files`
brings in `dist` and `src` and nothing else — because everything it describes is
test material that never reaches a consumer.

`@yurenju/frond` ships no runtime dependencies at all, so the tarball carries no
third-party code, and the notices below are about the repository rather than
about anything a consumer installs.

## foliate-js

<https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate-js>

frond is a reimplementation, not a port: no foliate-js code is used in `src/`,
and foliate-js is not a dependency of the published package (ADR-0001).

What *is* incorporated is upstream's `tests/epubcfi-tests.js` — the CFI strings
and comparison cases from it are used verbatim as an acceptance table in
`tests/node/cfi/foliate-acceptance.test.ts`. That file is test material, not
part of the published package, but it lives in this public repository and so
carries the notice below.

The browser quirk knowledge recorded in `docs/browser-quirks.md` was learned by
reading foliate-js, but knowledge is not code and carries no licence obligation
(ADR-0001).

## The public-domain books in the repository's `tests/books/`

Two complete EPUB publications are redistributed in this repository, as
ADR-0007's second layer of test material. They sit at the root rather than inside
this package, because the app's browser suite opens the same two files. Both are
trimmed rather than verbatim: `scripts/trim-public-books.ts` is the trim, and
ADR-0007 records what came out of each. Neither is a dependency; they exist so
that a change to layout can be judged against a real book before a pull request.

### Kusamakura (草枕) — `kusamakura-vertical-japanese.epub`

An EPUB 3 sample publication of Natsume Sōseki's *Kusamakura*, produced by the
Japanese EPUB Specification Settlement Project (EPUB日本語拡張仕様策定プロジェクト)
from the Aozora Bunko transcription.

- Sample collection: <https://idpf.github.io/epub3-samples/30/samples.html>
- Source repository: <https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples>
- Text source: <https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000148/card776.html>

The underlying work is in the public domain — Natsume Sōseki died in 1916.

The sample collection states: "Unless otherwise specified, all samples listed
here are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0" (<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>).
The Kusamakura entry carries no per-sample override. The publication's own
package document specifies something more permissive, and that specification is
what this copy relies on:

```
<meta property="dcterms:rights">EPUB日本語拡張仕様策定プロジェクト</meta>
<meta property="dcterms:license" scheme="xsd:anyURI"
      >http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</meta>
```

The two media-overlay narration files in the original were the one exception —
they alone were licensed CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0, recorded by their own `dcterms:license`
statements. **They are not in this copy.** The trim removes them, and removes
those licence statements with them; nothing under a non-commercial term remains.

### Alice's Adventures in Wonderland — `alice-in-wonderland-horizontal.epub`

Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* (1865) with John Tenniel's
illustrations, as edited and typeset by Standard Ebooks.

- Ebook: <https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/john-tenniel>
- Source repository: <https://github.com/standardebooks/lewis-carroll_alices-adventures-in-wonderland_john-tenniel>

Standard Ebooks' edition is based on a Project Gutenberg transcription produced
in 2008 by Arthur DiBianca and David Widger, and on digital scans from the
Internet Archive. It is re-typeset and carries no Project Gutenberg header or
footer, so no Project Gutenberg trademark term applies to it.

The publication's `dc:rights`, reproduced verbatim:

```
The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United
States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright
restrictions in the United States. They may still be copyrighted in other
countries, so users located outside of the United States must check their local
laws before using this ebook. The creators of, and contributors to, this ebook
dedicate their contributions to the worldwide public domain via the terms in the
CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication
(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
```

The cover image of the original edition is adapted from *Amanita*, an 1879
painting by Ivan Shishkin. The cover and title pages use League Spartan and Sorts
Mill Goudy, created by The League of Moveable Type.
