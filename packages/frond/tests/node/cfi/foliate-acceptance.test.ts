 * foliate-js's `tests/epubcfi-tests.js` (280 lines, upstream's only test) run through
 * once as an **acceptance table**.
 *
 * ## Licence
 *
 * The CFI strings and comparison cases in this file are taken verbatim from upstream, so
 * it carries upstream's copyright notice:
 *
 *     Copyright (c) 2022 John Factotum
 *     MIT License — https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate-js
 *
 * The full text MIT requires is kept in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` at the repo root.
 * **This is the only file in the whole repo under that obligation**: `src/` contains not
 * one line of upstream code (ADR-0001), and the published npm package excludes `tests/`.
 *
 * **This reads its cases, not its code** (ADR-0001: frond is a reimplementation, not a
 * port). That file's value is in being a **record of one reading** of the CFI spec —
 * which strings should parse to what, and which position sorts before which. frond's
 * oracle is still the spec itself; this table's job is to ask "does any case read
 * differently", and every difference has to be explained case by case as either a
 * different reading of the spec or a frond bug.
 *
 * ## Case by case
 *
 * foliate's file has five blocks:
 *
 * | # | Block | This ticket | Result |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | 1 | Taking an element off the OPF with `/6/4[chap01ref]` | **Outside the grammar layer** (`toElement` needs a DOM) | The strings' own parse/round trip is covered here |
 * | 2 | Offsets and ranges on XHTML, round-tripped through the DOM | **Outside the grammar layer** (`toRange`/`fromRange` need a DOM) | As above; the range grammar is verified here |
 * | 3 | The FILTER_SKIP-wrapped selection regression (upstream #100) | **Outside the grammar layer** (DOM filter behaviour) | As above |
 * | 4 | Special characters in ID assertions | **Exactly this layer** | Agrees throughout |
 * | 5 | `compare`'s seven cases | **Exactly this layer** | Agrees throughout |
 *
 * Blocks 1 through 3 want the "CFI ↔ DOM position" correspondence, and that takes a
 * rendered document — it belongs to `Renderer` (#31's boundary). Their **strings** are
 * still this layer's obligation, so they are taken in all the same and run through parse
 * → serialize.
 *
 * **Every CFI string appearing in that file is run here**, including both of its
 * ten-iteration loops — the difference between "ran roughly all of it" and "ran it" is
 * precisely why an acceptance table exists.
 *
 * **Disagreements: none at all.** The only difference needing explanation is
 * normalization rather than reading — see "redundant escapes like `^/`" below.
