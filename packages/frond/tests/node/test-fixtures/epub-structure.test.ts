/**
 * The generator's acceptance criterion cannot just be "the script threw no exception".
 * This group breaks "the output is a conforming book" into assertions that can each go
 * red on their own: what the manifest declares really is in the archive, the
 * readingOrder points into the manifest, TOC hrefs resolve to Sections, and every XML
 * document is well-formed.
 *
 * Well-formedness matters most: XHTML is not HTML. One missing end tag and a browser
 * does not forgivingly repair it the way it would for HTML — it refuses to render the
 * whole document. And the generator assembles its output from string templates, which is
 * exactly where that breaks most easily.
