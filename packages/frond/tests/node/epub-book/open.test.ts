    // Every other test goes through a relative path (that is this repo's internal
    // idiom), but what the consumer gets is the route through package.json's exports —
    // and if nobody walks that route, a typo in a path makes nothing go red.
    //
    // **That route points at `dist/`, not `src/`**, so this test needs `npm run build`
    // to have run before there is anything to load (`npm install`'s `prepare` runs it;
    // in the container the Dockerfile does). That is exactly where its value is: it is
    // the only test that executes the shipped artifact, proving the emitted JavaScript
    // actually runs — a botched extension rewrite or a typo in an `exports` path goes
    // red right here.
    //
    // The assertion is "a book opens" rather than "this is the same object the relative
    // import gives": the latter happened to hold back when exports pointed at src, but
    // that was a coincidence rather than a fact worth guarding. Pointing at `dist/`
    // makes them different module instances by construction, and what the consumer
    // cares about was always whether it works.
    //
    // ## Why the specifier goes through a variable
    //
    // A literal `import("@yurenju/frond/epub")` would make **tsc resolve that route
    // too**, so `npm run typecheck` would start requiring `dist/` to exist — a freshly
    // cloned, not-yet-built tree would get `TS2307: Cannot find module
    // '@yurenju/frond/epub'`, and that message gives no hint that the real cause is
    // "not built yet".
    //
    // Going through a variable makes tsc give up resolving (the type degrades to
    // `any`), and this test goes back to being what it always should have been: **an
    // assertion about runtime**. The shipped artifact's type half is not this test's
    // business — `release.yml` verifies that with a fake consumer outside the repo and
    // `skipLibCheck: false`, and that vantage point is more accurate than this one
    // because it looks in from outside, like a real consumer.
    // When `dist/` is absent, Node throws `Cannot find package '@yurenju/frond'` — a
    // message that points at the `exports` configuration when the real cause is "not
    // built yet". Say so first.
