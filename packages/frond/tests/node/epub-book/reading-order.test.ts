/**
 * readingOrder — a book's reading order, the packaging format's `<spine>`
 * (CONTEXT.md).
 *
 * This group guards two things: **the order**, and **which file inside the archive
 * each Section points at**. Get the order wrong and the reader skips chapters; get the
 * path wrong and that slot shows no content — and the latter goes falsely green very
 * easily on synthetic fixtures, because a fixture's href and its archive path look
 * almost identical (both under `EPUB/`). So the comma-in-the-path fixture is fed here
 * too, to pull "copy the href verbatim" and "resolve, then look up" apart.
