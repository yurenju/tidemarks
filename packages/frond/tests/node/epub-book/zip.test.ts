/**
 * The hand-written ZIP reader, compared byte for byte against `fflate`.
 *
 * `fflate` is a **reference implementation** (CONTEXT.md): it appears only in tests, and
 * frond ships with zero runtime dependencies. It is the source of answers rather than
 * hand-written expected values because hand-written expectations only verify "the ZIP
 * format as I understand it" — and an implementation that reads the format wrongly
 * writes its tests with the same misunderstanding, both sides wrong together and the
 * tests still green.
 *
 * The synthetic fixtures are all stored (ADR-0007's determinism), so **they alone never
 * exercise deflate**, while 3308 of the sample's 3309 entries are deflated. So a batch
 * is compressed here with `fflate` on the spot: the compressing side is a reference
 * implementation too, and frond only reads.
