 * state** (#8).
 *
 * Assertions are made against `reason` rather than the literal message: the message is
 * for humans and gets rewritten with the wording; `reason` is part of the public API,
 * and a bookshelf uses it to tell "this file is not a book at all" (reject outright)
 * from "this book's packaging is broken" (worth telling the reader about).
 *
 * None of these shapes can be produced as a committed fixture — the fixture generator
 * only writes conforming books (ADR-0007) — so the books in this group are assembled
 * byte by byte by hand.
