 * metadata — what a book declares about itself. A bookshelf shelves by it, so this
 * group is the "get the title, authors and language" acceptance criterion.
 *
 * ## Page progression direction is not writing mode
 *
 * `page-progression-direction` is about **which way turning pages advances**, is
 * declared in the package document, and is reported by `EpubBook`. **Writing mode
 * (vertical or horizontal) is not here** — it is written in the stylesheet and needs a
 * CSSOM to be judged accurately, so `Renderer` reports it (ADR-0010, CONTEXT.md).
 * Merging the two into one field would give a vertical LTR book and a horizontal RTL
 * book the same answer.
