/**
 * Assembles a book's bytes by hand, so `EpubBook`'s tests can be fed the **shapes no
 * fixture has**.
 *
 * The synthetic fixtures (`tests/fixtures/*.epub`) do the bulk of the work, one file
 * per ailment (ADR-0007), and they are always **conforming books that open** — the
 * generator refuses to emit even a combination like "EPUB 2 with a
 * page-progression-direction". Broken books therefore cannot be produced at that
 * layer: not a zip at all, a missing `META-INF/container.xml`, an OPF pointing at a
 * file that does not exist. None of those shapes is expressible by that generator, and
 * they are exactly what this ticket's error-handling acceptance criterion needs to be
 * fed.
 *
 * So the books here are **written byte by byte by the tests themselves**: the full OPF
 * text lives in the test, and this layer only packs it. That also gives the assertions
 * an independent source for their expected values — rather than checking the generator
 * against its own inverse.
 *
 * These books deliberately **do not go into `tests/fixtures/`**: each serves a single
 * error path, needs no sharing across runners, and should not take up an "ailment"
 * name. The shapes that genuinely need to be in the repo (a `../` in the manifest, for
 * instance) come from #23.
