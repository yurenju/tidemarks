/**
 * A manifest `href` resolves against the package document by **URL rules**.
 *
 * This group guards a path that **misreports good books**: a comment on #8 records a
 * book from the Kobo channel whose OPF sits at `OEBPS/content.opf` and whose manifest
 * contains `href="../js/kobo.js"`, with `js/kobo.js` genuinely present at the package
 * root. That is a conforming book. An implementation that concatenates strings would
 * look for the literal ZIP entry name `OEBPS/../js/kobo.js`, fail to find it, and judge
 * a good book to be "an OPF pointing at a file that does not exist".
 *
 * A committed fixture playing this shape comes from #23 (that axis is running in
 * parallel). Until it lands, the resolution rule is guarded here with a handmade book;
 * once the fixture arrives an end-to-end case can be added.
