/**
 * A reader setting turned into CSS text: what `readerStylesheet` emits, which properties
 * `overriddenProperties` puts in scope, how a patch merges. Strings and objects only —
 * no engine, no geometry, so this is the layer that proves the *rules* exhaustively.
 *
 * This group's weight is not on "what happens when something is set" but on **what
 * happens when nothing is** — ADR-0003's threshold is "a reader setting is blocked by
 * the book", which does not hold without a reader setting, and an implementation that
 * misses that runs an override pass on every single book with nobody noticing: the
 * screen looks fine, the author's design has simply been erased.
 *
 * The neighbours: whether those rules survive the book's cascade and land on the text is
 * measured in three real engines in `tests/browser/renderer/reader-settings.spec.ts`, which
 * keeps one wiring case per proposition rather than repeating this table. Which frond
 * parameter a reader's choice in Tidemarks becomes is `packages/app/src/lib/settings.test.ts`.
