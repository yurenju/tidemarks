/**
 * The two public-domain books of ADR-0007's second layer, checked for **being intact** —
 * not for being rendered correctly.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole design of this file. A real book has no correct answer to
 * assert against: nobody wrote down how many pages `草枕` should occupy, and pinning
 * today's number would turn current behaviour into a specification. So this layer's
 * rendering is judged by eye before a PR (`docs/agents/pull-requests.md`) and nothing here
 * looks at geometry.
 *
 * What *does* have a correct answer is whether `scripts/trim-public-books.ts` produced a
 * whole book. The trim removes narration from one and nine chapters from the other, and
 * every removal has to be matched in the package document, the navigation document and the
 * NCX. Get one of those wrong and the book still opens — it just quietly points at
 * resources that are no longer there, and the visual reading it exists for would be a
 * reading of our error handling instead. These assertions are about the trim, and their
 * oracle is the archive itself: every path a book names has to be a path the book carries.
