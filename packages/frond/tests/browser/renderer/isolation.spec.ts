/**
 * User stories 52 and 53.
 *
 * > Because of WebKit bug 218086, an iframe has to carry `allow-scripts` to emit events at
 * > all, and once it does, the sandbox loses most of its isolation value. frond therefore
 * > **does not support** EPUB scripted content … this is a **security decision, not a
 * > feature trade-off**.
 *
 * "Does not support" has exactly one meaning in implementation: **nothing that can run may
 * be left in a state where it could**. The sandbox is no help (`allow-scripts` was forced
 * open by WebKit) and neither is the origin (`blob:` carries the consumer app's own origin).
 * So this spec is that defence's only guard.
 *
 * ## Emptied where it stands, not removed
 *
 * Each such element keeps its place in the tree and loses everything else: every attribute,
 * every child. Removing it instead would shift the CFI index of every following sibling by
 * two, and a CFI is what a reader's progress and highlights are stored as (#65). The last
 * group in this file is where that is measured.
 *
 * The cost of emptying rather than removing is that the invariant gets **weaker**: "this
 * element is not in the document" cannot be eroded, whereas "this element carries nothing"
 * can be, by any later pass that sets attributes by tag name. `nothing is left that could
 * act` below is the guard against that erosion.
 *
 * The content is hand-written through `mountInline` rather than made a committed fixture:
 * ADR-0007's discipline is one file per **layout ailment**, and "the book contains a
 * script" is a security property, not a layout ailment.

 * off the index of every sibling after it. That would make frond's own CFIs unreadable by
 * other readers, and other readers' CFIs resolve **to the wrong node** inside frond — not
 * fail to resolve, which is loud, but silently name a different sentence. Progress and
 * annotations are stored as CFIs, so that is the whole of what breaks.
 *
 * Emptying in place is what keeps the count: an emptied `<script>` is still one element
 * child, so nothing after it moves.
 *
 * ## No real book has ever exercised this
 *
 * 34 books in circulation, 1638 sections: `<script>` in `<body>` is **0**, and so are
 * `<iframe>` / `<object>` / `<embed>` / `<frame>` and `on*` attributes. The 1456 scripts that
 * do exist are all in `<head>` — where removal shifted nothing an annotation could point at
 * either, because `<head>` is `/2` and `<body>` is `/4` regardless of what is inside
 * `<head>`. So the `scripted-content-in-body` fixture is synthetic; no real book has this
 * shape (ADR-0007). It was fixed while the cost of fixing it was zero: ADR-0006 makes a
 * removal-shaped intervention a CFI-level breaking change, and that price only ever goes up
 * as readers accumulate stored positions (#65).
