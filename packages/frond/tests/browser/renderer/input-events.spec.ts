/**
 * ## Why this is indispensable
 *
 * A section renders inside an iframe (ADR-0006), and an iframe's boundary blocks event
 * bubbling — a consumer with a listener on the container receives nothing at all. Without
 * this outlet, swipe-to-turn, tap-the-sides-to-turn and the arrow keys while the content
 * has focus **all do nothing**, and with no error message.
 *
 * ## Why frond sends only these
 *
 * What it sends is facts: at this moment, at this point in container coordinates, a
 * pointer went down, and these two DOM conditions held at the time. "Swiping left means
 * next page" and "tapping the right third turns the page" are policy, and belong to the
 * consumer (ADR-0002). So not one assertion here reads "after the swipe it turned to the
 * next page" — that is not frond's behaviour.
 *
 * It uses Playwright's real mouse and keyboard rather than synthetic events: coordinate
 * conversion and focus routing are the two things most easily got wrong in this slot, and
 * synthetic events bypass both.

/**
 * `preventTapDefault()` — the one thing a press can decide while it is still happening.
 *
 * ## What is actually being defended against, and why it cannot be tested here
 *
 * Chrome for Android selects a word out of a plain tap on text and raises a search bar over
 * the page (Touch to Search). The reader taps the edge to turn the page and gets a search
 * bar; the selection can be dropped afterwards, but the bar belongs to the browser and no
 * page script takes it back down. **No desktop engine does this**, so the behaviour itself
 * is out of reach of this suite.
 *
 * ## Why the mechanism is this one
 *
 * It used to make the document unselectable for as long as the press lasted — the condition
 * Chrome's own documentation names as one Touch to Search will not fire on. Measured on a
 * phone, that only made the bar rarer: 21% of taps raised it anyway, against 72% with
 * nothing at all. Cancelling the touch that ends the press is what actually stopped it, 0
 * times in 15 (#80).
 *
 * So what is pinned here is that mechanism — the `touchend` of a press that asked is
 * cancelled, the press still reaches the consumer, and no answer carries into the next
 * press. Whether the bar is really gone is confirmed by hand, on a phone.
