// Each of the three routes that move every rectangle, and whether `layout` is emitted on it.
// The measurement is that the rectangles really moved, which needs a laid-out document; the
// emitter that carries the event is pure and is tested in tests/node/renderer/events.test.ts.
// The order a mount emits its events in is pinned here too — placing `layout` between `load`
// and `relocate` states all three — while what each one carries is pagination.spec.ts.

/**
 * The `layout` event: "the geometry is valid again, recompute".
 *
 * `rectsFor()` answers **which rectangles a range occupies**, and a consumer drawing its own
 * highlight layer needs a second answer alongside it — **when those rectangles stop being
 * true**. Before this event existed, one of the three routes that move every rectangle sent
 * no signal at all:
 *
 * | Route | `load` | `relocate` |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | a section loads | yes | yes |
 * | `applySettings()` | yes (the document is rebuilt) | de-duplicated away on page 0 |
 * | `relayout()` | **no** — it only lays out again | de-duplicated away on page 0 |
 *
 * The resize row is the fatal one, because resizing is what frond's own `ResizeObserver`
 * fires: opening a side panel over a highlight is a container resize, so "the interaction a
 * highlight exists for" landed on the one route with no signal.
 *
 * `relocate`'s de-duplication is **correct** and untouched by this — the reader really did
 * not move. What was missing was a separate fact, and this spec measures it on all three
 * routes.
