/**
 * **No frond code takes part in this spec** ("who laid this number out" in
 * `docs/browser-quirks.md`): `page.setContent` feeds hand-written HTML/CSS, and what is
 * measured is the browser's own behaviour, which still holds with a different renderer. It
 * pins the premises every formula in `src/renderer/geometry.ts` depends on — built on the
 * wrong axis, those formulas produce "several pages stacked on one screen" rather than a
 * red test.
 *
 * ## Why this has to be measured
 *
 * A vertical layout's column axis is where intuition most easily goes wrong at this layer,
 * and going wrong raises nothing: `column-width` applied in the wrong direction is still a
 * legal declaration, the page still draws, and only the amount of content per page is
 * wrong. spine's hard-won "a vertical column's width must equal exactly one viewer height"
 * is about precisely this, but it gives the conclusion without the reason, so whoever
 * copies it does not know which number to change for a different viewport shape.
 *
 * The derivation from the spec: multicol's columns are laid out along and overflow the
 * **inline axis**, and `column-width` measures a single column's **inline size**.
 * Horizontal (`horizontal-tb`) has a horizontal inline axis, so the column width is the
 * width and the overflow is horizontal; vertical (`vertical-rl`) has a vertical inline
 * axis (characters run top to bottom), so **the column width is the height and the
 * overflow is vertical**. This spec turns that derivation into a measurement on all three
 * engines.
