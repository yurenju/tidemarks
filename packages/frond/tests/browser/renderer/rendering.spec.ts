/**
 * A table taller than a column — **the three engines disagree, frond cannot fix it, and so

 *
 * Written the way `regional-faces.spec.ts` handles #4: rather than expecting the three to
 * agree, each engine's measured behaviour goes into a table and the assertion is that they
 * are still that way. The divergence is a property of the browsers and frond decides
 * whether to intervene from it, so somebody has to know when it changes.
 *
 * ## Why `cap-overflowing-boxes` does nothing for tables
 *
 * `:root table { max-block-size: <one column>px }` is a no-op on a table: CSS specifies
 * that `height` / `max-height` are a **minimum** rather than a maximum on
 * `display: table` elements, and a table always grows to its content. The plate case
 * (`plate-taller-than-page`) is fixable precisely because replaced elements have no such
 * exception — which is why the two fixtures cannot be merged.
 *
 * ## Why it is not fixed
 *
 * The route that remains is replacing `display: table` (as block, each row becomes a block
 * and the content flows into the adjacent columns, all of it reachable), at the cost of
 * **losing the table's alignment entirely**. Whether "readable but misaligned" beats
 * "aligned but half invisible" is a trade-off decision rather than a bug fix, so it is
 * registered as a gap (`src/renderer/interventions.ts`) rather than quietly done here.
 *
 * Nine sections across three books in the sample have this shape, the worst of them
 * clipping 2563px.
