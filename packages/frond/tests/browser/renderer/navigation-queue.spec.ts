/**
 * The semantics of rapid operations: page turns accumulate, setting changes replace.
 *
 * ## Why this layer is needed
 *
 * A cross-section operation has an await in the middle (attaching the iframe, waiting for
 * fonts), and **the consumer does not wait**. frond originally recognized stale loads with
 * a generation counter, which guarded "no leftover iframes" but not "N presses advance N
 * times": pressing twice at a section boundary, the second read a view that was still the
 * old one, and the two inputs advanced by one section.
 *
 * This slot is barely visible with keys alone, and is the norm once swipe-to-turn is wired
 * up.
 *
 * ## Two semantics, not one
 *
 * Queueing everything is wrong: dragging a margin slider fires one `applySettings` per
 * `input` notch, and running each of them to completion serially freezes the slider. What
 * that side wants is "only the last one counts". So the two describes below verify
 * **opposite** behaviours, and both are right.
