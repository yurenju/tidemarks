/**
 * **The claim the whole tree layer rests on**: a browser and a Worker, handed the same
 * section, write the same CFI.
 *
 * `src/epub/tree.ts` argues that addressing is a rule about trees, so one walk can serve
 * both. The walk being shared is not enough on its own, because the **trees** are not: one
 * comes from the browser's XML parser, the other from `xml.ts`. They differ in at least two
 * known ways — comments exist in one and not the other, and a run of text containing an
 * entity reference arrives as several nodes in one and as a single node in the other.
 *
 * The addressing rule is supposed to absorb both (comments occupy no position; adjacent text
 * merges into one chunk before anything is numbered). "Supposed to" is why this file exists.
 * Reasoning cannot settle it: the question is what a real XML parser in a real browser does
 * with real markup, and the only instrument for that is a real browser.
 *
 * ## Why every character rather than a sample
 *
 * The failures worth catching are off-by-one at a seam — the first character after an inline
 * tag, the last one before a comment, the join between two text nodes. Choosing which
 * positions to check means guessing where the seams are, which is the same guess that put
 * the bug there. Walking all of them costs milliseconds.
 *
 * ## Why the books here are the ones in the repository
 *
 * ADR-0007's second layer: two public-domain books, committed. Books under copyright are
 * used for **observation only** — run the scan, find the shape that breaks, then reproduce
 * that shape as a synthetic fixture. Their text does not enter the repository.
