/**
 * ADR-0004 has been narrowed twice by measurement, so first, plainly, what this compares
 * and what it does not:
 *
 * | | Compared | Basis |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Writing mode | **yes** | Independent of layout; the result of the book's declaration plus the CSSOM |
 * | Each section's first-page CFI | **yes** | That is the section's first text node, unrelated to page breaks |
 * | The book's character count and each section's starting fraction | **yes** | A character count is a property of the book, not of the layout |
 * | Column width and inline size | **yes** | Computed from the viewport and the settings, not measured |
 * | Page counts, break positions, page numbers | **no** | ADR-0004's #7 revision: the three engines' multicol fragmentation does not agree by construction |
 *
 * ## How the three are "compared"
 *
 * Playwright runs the three as three independent projects, and none can see the others'
 * results. So the diff is written as **each engine asserting against the same expected
 * values**: any engine deviating goes red on its own. The effect is the same as comparing
 * them pairwise, with one bonus — the expected values are written in the test, so whoever
 * reads the diff can see what the number is.
 *
 * The expected values are always **computed independently** rather than copied from some
 * run: the character count sums `PROSE` directly, and the CFIs are derived from the spec's
 * addressing rules. Copied from a run, this spec could only prove "the behaviour has not
 * changed", never "the behaviour is right".
