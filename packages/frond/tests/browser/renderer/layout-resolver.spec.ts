/**
 * ## The gap `resolveLayout` closes
 *
 * The writing mode is declared in the book's stylesheet and settled by the browser, so
 * frond has no answer for it until the document is displayed (`writing-mode.ts`). A
 * consumer whose margin depends on it — a line-length ceiling falls on the **inline** axis,
 * which is horizontal in one mode and vertical in the other — therefore had nowhere to
 * compute that margin:
 *
 * | When | What is known | What is wrong with deciding here |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | before `attach()` | nothing about this book's layout | the fact does not exist yet |
 * | the first `load` | the writing mode | the position has already been restored, so correcting the margin lays out a second time — and the reader lands somewhere else in the section |
 *
 * The consumer that walked into this (spine) answered it with a `localStorage` cache of
 * what the book laid out as last time. That is a guess dressed as a fact: right most of the
 * time, wrong on the first open of every vertical book, and one more piece of device state
 * to delete along with the book.
 *
 * So the fact is handed over **at the moment frond has it and before it lays anything
 * out**, and the consumer answers with policy (ADR-0002). What this spec measures is that
 * the answer is in force for the **first** layout — the whole point — and that it is asked
 * again on every later one, since neither fact is a property of the book.

/**
 * One answer per writing mode, and **deliberately different numbers**.
 *
 * A table answering both modes alike would pass whichever way round the two are landed on
 * the four physical edges — which is the mistake this feature exists to make impossible.
