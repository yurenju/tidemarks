/**
 * Feeding frond into a browser.
 *
 * ## Why there is no bundler
 *
 * `Renderer`'s module graph contains **not one bare specifier** — it depends only on
 * `src/renderer/` itself and two zero-dependency pure-function modules from `src/epub/`
 * (`cfi.ts`, `resource-path.ts`). The decompression and XML parsing packages live at the
 * `EpubBook` layer, and `Renderer` takes the narrow `RenderableBook` interface rather
 * than `EpubBook` (`src/renderer/book.ts`).
 *
 * That leaves one thing to do to get the source into the page: strip TypeScript's types.
 * Node's built-in `stripTypeScriptTypes` does exactly that, so no bundler has to be
 * introduced — and so no second module-resolution configuration, differing from the real
 * build, has to exist for the tests. When that kind of configuration drifts, the symptom
 * is "tests green but the consumer cannot build".
 *
 * Stripping rather than transpiling costs the ability to use non-erasable syntax in the
 * source (`enum`, `namespace`, constructor parameter properties). That restriction is the
 * same one `tsconfig.json` already accepts so that `node` can run `src/` directly, so
 * nothing new is being constrained.
 *
 * ## Why interception rather than a server
 *
 * The container runs with `--network=none` (`scripts/test-in-container.sh`). Playwright's
 * route interception takes a request before it leaves the browser, so not even loopback
 * is needed — one fewer thing to turn into an irreproducible red test in somebody else's
 * environment.

 *
 * **The click is retried, not just waited on.** Firefox delivers a click into the frame and
 * then, occasionally, does not move the focus with it — measured under contention: frond's
 * own recording shows `pointerdown` / `pointerup` arriving inside the frame while the outer
