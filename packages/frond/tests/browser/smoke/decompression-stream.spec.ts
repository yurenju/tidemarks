/**
 * frond's decompression goes through `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')`
 * (`src/epub/zip.ts`), and without it no book opens
 * at all — an EPUB's container is a ZIP, and 3308 of the sample's 3309 entries are
 * deflated. This is frond's one platform assumption outside the ES standard, so it
 * deserves a test of its own: when the assumption fails, this is what should go red,
 * rather than "this book will not open" scattered everywhere.
 *
 * `deflate-raw` and `deflate` are two different things — the latter carries zlib's
 * two-byte header, which a ZIP entry does not have. Fed the wrong one, decompression
 * rejects, so a small piece of actual compressed data is verified alongside rather than
 * only asking whether the constructor exists: asking only that would silently pass an
 * engine that knows `deflate` but not `deflate-raw`.
