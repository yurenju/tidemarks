/**
 * Every XML document in the synthetic fixtures really does parse in all three browsers.
 *
 * The fixture generator assembles its output from string templates, and **XHTML is not
 * HTML**: one missing end tag, one unquoted attribute, one unescaped `&`, and a browser
 * does not forgivingly repair it the way it would for HTML — it refuses to render the
 * whole document. That failure mode is invisible at the Node layer — `EpubBook` reads
 * metadata without building a DOM — and holds out all the way to `Renderer` before
 * exploding, far from its cause.
 *
 * The browsers' own DOMParser is used deliberately rather than a Node XML library (that
 * case is covered by `tests/node/test-fixtures/epub-structure.test.ts`): the question is
 * "do these three engines accept it", and only these three engines can answer it.
 *
 * The filename list is taken from the generator rather than copied out here. Copied, this
 * spec would silently fail to cover a newly added ailment — and "not covered" never goes
 * red.
