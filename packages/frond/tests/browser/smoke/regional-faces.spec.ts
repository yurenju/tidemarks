/**
 * Noto CJK is one family covering Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese,
 * but that is not the same as one face: the OTC contains Noto Serif CJK TC / SC / JP and
 * others. Which one is picked depends on face selection, and face selection is decided by
 * lang plus fontconfig's language matching — which is exactly where the three browsers may
 * each go their own way. Bound badly, the three may pick different faces for the same
 * Japanese book, and the cross-browser diff lights up red for reasons unrelated to frond's
 * code.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * Which character to test with matters more than how to assert. Measured
 * conclusions — do not change them on intuition.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Han characters **cannot** discriminate between faces. The regional forms of Han
 * unification exemplars like 骨 and 直 are driven by the document's lang through
 * OpenType's locl feature — one face gives different forms under lang=ja and lang=zh-TW,
 * and different faces give the same form under one lang. Asking a Han character "which
 * face was resolved" always answers "cannot tell", so the test goes green even in an
 * environment where the binding is entirely broken.
 *
 * Punctuation **can**. The full stop sits differently in the JP and TC faces (Japanese
 * places it at the top right or bottom left, Chinese centres it), and that difference
 * persists under one lang — which makes it a difference of the face itself.
 *
 * The first group of tests below pins those two properties, because they are the premise
 * on which the second group rests.

/**
 * ===========================================================================
 * Resolving a generic family by lang — the three engines disagree, and it
 * cannot be fixed (#4)
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This section was once marked fixme, waiting for "get the three to agree". After
 * investigation the conclusion is that it **cannot be done**, so it instead pins each
 * engine's actual behaviour: the divergence is itself a property of this test environment,
 * and somebody has to know when it changes. The reasoning and measurements are in
 * docs/browser-quirks.md and the conclusion in issue #4.
 *
 * Each engine bypasses fontconfig's generic bindings differently:
 *
 *   Firefox   asks fontconfig for serif/sans-serif with the book's lang → the bindings
 *             take full effect.
 *   WebKit    does ask fontconfig for the generic family, but without the book's lang; the
 *             missing lang is filled in by fontconfig from **the process's locale**, so the
 *             whole process shares one regional face. The container's locale is C.UTF-8,
 *             which lands on the general rule's TC.
 *   Chromium  does not ask fontconfig for the generic family at all — that is Blink's own
 *             font preference, resolving to Liberation Serif/Sans, which have no CJK; the
 *             CJK characters then go through per-character fallback, which brings in a
 *             separate font.
 *
 * frond does not intervene (ADR-0003: an ugly book is no reason to intervene, and neither
 * is three engines disagreeing). For the cross-browser self-diff to hold, the face has to
 * be named by **reader settings** — named, the three agree, and those tests are above.
 */

/**
 * Generic family + the face that lang actually lands on. Changing this table requires a
 * measurement.
 *
 * Chromium's entries are **font stacks** rather than single faces, because its generic
 * family is two-stage: the primary font (Liberation Serif/Sans) decides the line height
 * and baseline but has no CJK glyphs, and the CJK is filled in by per-character fallback.
 * Comparing against a single Noto CJK face would come out unequal — the glyphs match, but
 * the baseline is set by the primary font and the position differs by a few pixels. The
 * stack spelling reproduces both stages.
 *
 * It is also why Chromium's sans-serif still counts as disagreeing: the regional face is
 * picked correctly, but the primary font is a Latin one, its line height differs from the
 * other two, and the line breaking differs with it.
