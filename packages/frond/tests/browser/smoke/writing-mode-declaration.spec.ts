/**
 * **Which spelling** a book declares vertical writing with, and whether the three engines
 * accept it.
 *
 * How this group divides work with `vertical-writing.spec.ts`: that one asks "can this
 * environment lay out vertically" (a property of the environment), this one asks "when the
 * book declares it like this, does the browser accept it" (browser behaviour). The latter
 * is a quirk, registered in `docs/browser-quirks.md`.
 *
 * The trigger was a real book. One of ADR-0007's triggers, 《入境大廳》 (produced by Adobe
 * InDesign 17.0.1, EPUB 3, Traditional Chinese vertical), declares `-epub-writing-mode` and
 * `-webkit-writing-mode` on `<body>` — with **the unprefixed `writing-mode` never
 * appearing once**. Measured, Firefox recognizes neither prefix, so that book lays out
 * horizontally throughout in Firefox.
 *
 * **This group is not saying "Firefox's vertical writing is broken".** Firefox's vertical
 * support is complete, and the most correct of the three (WebKit is the one that does not
 * apply `vert` when vertical). What it does not recognize is two vendor-prefixed property
 * names — and the first test is the control: the same Firefox behaves as soon as the
 * property name is the standard `writing-mode`. Strictly, Firefox is right here; no
 * specification requires it to implement another vendor's prefix. What is broken is the
 * book that writes only prefixes and not the standard property.
 *
 * This passage is here because the claim "foliate's vertical writing is broken in Firefox"
 * was once taken as fact and written into #1's work ordering, and was finally withdrawn by
 * #7's measurements (see docs/browser-quirks.md). Do not let it grow back out of these
 * tests' names.
 *
 * This group deliberately **pins the divergence rather than expecting the three to agree**,
 * for the same reason as `regional-faces.spec.ts`: the divergence is a property of the
 * browsers and frond decides whether to intervene from it, so somebody has to know when it
 * changes.
 *
 * ## Why this does not read `writing-mode-prefixed-only.epub`
 *
 * The same shape now has a synthetic fixture too (#24). This group still feeds style
 * fragments through `page.setContent`, because what it asks is **the browser's behaviour**
 * — "does this engine accept this CSS" — and that has nothing to do with whether the
 * declaration is wrapped in an EPUB; padding an extra layer of packaging in between only
 * adds explanations for a red test that have nothing to do with the question. Loading a
 * whole book into the browser had to wait for `Renderer` to exist (after #8), and by then
 * the question to ask is a different one: has frond normalized the prefixes away.
 *
 * On the browser side that fixture is currently covered by `fixture-parsing.spec.ts` — its
 * filename list is taken from the generator, so a new fixture is covered automatically with
 * no copy needed here.
